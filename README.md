# KNN_experiment
Implementations and analysis of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using different priority queue implementations to find the k closest points to a given query point in a high-dimensional space. 

This repository contains the 8 files, that is, this file (README.md), KNN.java, LabelledPoint.java, PointSet.java, PriorityQueueIF.java, PriorityQueue1.java, PriorityQueue2.java, and PriorityQueue3.java. It also includes a PDF containing the results and discussions for the experiments.
